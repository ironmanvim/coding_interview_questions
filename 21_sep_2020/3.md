<div style="padding:16px">Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Twitter:<br><br>

A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards and forwards. Given a string, s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.<br><br>Example: <pre style="font-size:12px;font-family:courier;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:4px">Input: "banana"<br>Output: "anana"<br><br>Input: "million"<br>Output: "illi"<br></pre><br>

```python
class Solution: 
    def longestPalindrome(self, s):
      # Fill this in.
        
# Test program
s = "tracecars"
print(str(Solution().longestPalindrome(s)))
# racecar
```
