<div style="padding:16px">Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:<br><br>

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.<br><br>Here is an example solution in Python language.  (Any language is OK to use in an interview, though we'd recommend Python as a generalist language utilized by companies like Google, Facebook, Netflix, Dropbox, Pinterest, Uber, etc.,)<br><br>
```python
class Solution:
  def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
    # Fill this in.

print Solution().lengthOfLongestSubstring('abrkaabcdefghijjxxx')
# 10
```
</div><br>Can you find a solution in linear time?<br><br>
