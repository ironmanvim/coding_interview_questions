Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by AirBNB:<br><br>

Given a sorted array, A, with possibly duplicated elements, find the indices of the first and last occurrences of a target element, x. Return -1 if the target is not found.<br><br>Example:<pre style="font-size:12px;font-family:courier;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:4px">Input: A = [1,3,3,5,7,8,9,9,9,15], target = 9<br>Output: [6,8]<br><br>Input: A = [100, 150, 150, 153], target = 150<br>Output: [1,2]<br><br>Input: A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,10], target = 9<br>Output: [-1, -1]<br></pre>Here is a function signature example:<br>
```python
class Solution: 
  def getRange(self, arr, target):
    # Fill this in.
  
# Test program 
arr = [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 8] 
x = 2
print(Solution().getRange(arr, x))
# [1, 4]
```
