Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Uber:<br><br>

Imagine you are building a compiler. Before running any code, the compiler must check that the parentheses in the program are balanced. Every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket. We can approximate this using strings. <br><br>Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. <br>An input string is valid if:<br>- Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.<br>- Open brackets are closed in the correct order.<br>- Note that an empty string is also considered valid.<br><br>Example:<pre style="font-size:12px;font-family:courier;background-color:#f0f0f0;padding:4px">Input: "((()))"<br>Output: True<br><br>Input: "[()]{}"<br>Output: True<br><br>Input: "({[)]"<br>Output: False<br></pre><br>
```python
class Solution:
  def isValid(self, s):
    # Fill this in.

# Test Program
s = "()(){(())" 
# should return False
print(Solution().isValid(s))

s = ""
# should return True
print(Solution().isValid(s))

s = "([{}])()"
# should return True
print(Solution().isValid(s))
```
